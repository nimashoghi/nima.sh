This paper proposes a novel context-aware task handling technique for resource-constrained mobile robots. The approach combines a dynamic time-sharing mechanism, event-driven task scheduling using reactive programming, and lightweight virtualized execution to effectively handle multiple tasks concurrently while ensuring real-time performance. The technique is demonstrated on a Raspberry Pi-based robot performing tasks such as SLAM, sign detection, and speech processing.
