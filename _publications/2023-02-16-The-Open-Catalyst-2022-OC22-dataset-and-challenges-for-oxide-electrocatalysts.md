excerpt: 'Introduces the open source OC22 dataset, containing relaxations across various oxide materials, coverages, and adsorbates, to improve machine learning models for oxide electrocatalysts.  The paper also establishes clear benchmarks for future efforts in this area, opens the data and models for community development, and introduces a public leaderboard.'

Introduces the open source OC22 dataset, containing relaxations across various oxide materials, coverages, and adsorbates, to improve machine learning models for oxide electrocatalysts.  The paper also establishes clear benchmarks for future efforts in this area, opens the data and models for community development, and introduces a public leaderboard.
