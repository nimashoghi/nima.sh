Examines the inherent design complexities in autonomous drones—especially the trade-offs between compute, energy, and electromechanical resources—and proposes a systematic exploration of the drone design space. The study emphasizes the benefits of optimizing the SLAM process on FPGA platforms and introduces a customizable, open-source drone.
