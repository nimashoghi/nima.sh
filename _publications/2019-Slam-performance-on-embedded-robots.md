This paper investigates the feasibility of running the ORB-SLAM2 algorithm in real-time on the Raspberry Pi 3B+ for use in embedded robots. The researchers compare the performance and accuracy of ORB-SLAM2 on the Pi and a laptop using the EuRoC MAV dataset, and explore optimizations to speed up execution on the Pi while maintaining accuracy.
