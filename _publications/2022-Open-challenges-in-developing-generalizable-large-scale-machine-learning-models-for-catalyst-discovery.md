This paper discusses the challenges in developing generalizable machine learning models for catalyst discovery. While current approaches are effective for specific chemistries and compositions, they struggle to generalize across diverse chemical spaces. The paper highlights the potential of large-scale catalyst datasets like the Open Catalyst 2020 Data set (OC20) to enable the development of universal machine learning potentials that could accelerate catalyst discovery across various applications without requiring specialized training efforts.
