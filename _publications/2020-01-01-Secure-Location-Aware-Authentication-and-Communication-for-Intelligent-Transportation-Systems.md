excerpt: 'This paper introduces a new location-aware authentication protocol for intelligent transportation systems that streamlines message verification processes and the sender&apos;s location detection. The protocol proposes the use of visual authentication beacons to reduce additional computations and provide scalable, efficient, and trustworthy communication in a stand-alone network.'

This paper introduces a new location-aware authentication protocol for intelligent transportation systems that streamlines message verification processes and the sender&apos;s location detection. The protocol proposes the use of visual authentication beacons to reduce additional computations and provide scalable, efficient, and trustworthy communication in a stand-alone network.
