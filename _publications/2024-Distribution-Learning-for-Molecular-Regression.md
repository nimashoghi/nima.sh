This research proposes Distributional Mixture of Experts (DMoE), a novel method for molecular property regression that trains models to predict probability distributions of targets. By combining cross-entropy and L1 distance in the loss function, DMoE addresses key biases present in existing soft target regression methods. Evaluation on multiple datasets and architectures demonstrates the effectiveness of DMoE as a promising alternative to classical regression for molecular property prediction.
