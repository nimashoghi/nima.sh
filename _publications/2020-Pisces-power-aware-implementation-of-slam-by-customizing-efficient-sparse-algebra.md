This paper presents Pisces, a power-efficient approach to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for autonomous systems. By exploiting the sparsity of SLAM data, Pisces optimizes memory access patterns and enables pipelined and parallel processing, resulting in significant reductions in power consumption and execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods.
