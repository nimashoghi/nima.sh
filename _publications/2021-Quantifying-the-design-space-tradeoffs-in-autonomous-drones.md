This paper formalizes the fundamental subsystems of autonomous drones and explores the complex tradeoffs between their limited compute, energy, and electromechanical resources. By quantifying the impact of computations on the drone design space, the authors provide insights into how to optimize autonomous drone systems for various applications.
