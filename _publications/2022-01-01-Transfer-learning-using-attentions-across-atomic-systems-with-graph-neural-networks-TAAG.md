Introduces and evaluates an efficient model-training method, TAAG, that harnesses transfer learning and graph neural networks for improved molecular and catalyst discovery. TAAG promises universal domain application, faster training times, and improved adaptation, offering on average a 6% improvement over conventionally trained models.
