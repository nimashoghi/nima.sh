This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the hardware and software components of autonomous drones, with a focus on the widely-used open source flight stack, ArduCopter. The authors characterize the performance requirements and study how area-specific applications affect the flight stack, providing insights that can help optimize the underlying flight controller and dramatically increase the flying range of drones.
