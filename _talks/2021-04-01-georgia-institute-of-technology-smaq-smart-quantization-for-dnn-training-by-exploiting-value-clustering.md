This talk introduces the Smart Quantization (SmaQ) technique for DNN training. SmaQ is a novel quantization which exploits the observed (normally distributed) value clustering in DNNs to quantize neural network weight, gradient, feature map, gradient map, and optimizer state values. SmaQ is able to reduce memory usage during training by up to 6.7x with no loss in accuracy.
