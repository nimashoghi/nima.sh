This talk presents our work on a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture for abstractive legal text summarization. Combines PEGASUS' (from Zhang et al. 2020) pre-training objective with Longformer's (from Beltagy et al. 2020) dilated attention mechanism to create a model that can handle extremely long input sequences to generate summaries of legal documents. Achieves state-of-the-art summarization performance on the BIGPATENT dataset.
